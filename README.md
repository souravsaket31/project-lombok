# project-lombok

Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, 
spicing up your java. Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, 
automate your logging variables, and much more.

 Whenever we use IDEs to generate these boilerplate codes, we just save ourselves from writing all these codes but it is actually present in our source code and increases the LOC (lines of code), and reduces maintainability and readability. On the other hand, Lombok adds all these boilerplate codes at the compile-time in the “.class” file and not in our source code.
